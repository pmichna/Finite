Regular expressions to finite automata converter

You can use the following syntax:

- concatenation: ab
- Kleene star: a*
- parentheses: (ab)*
- operation under plus: a^+
- union: a+b
- no spaces allowed

The application works only for correct regular expressions! Input like "ab+" will produce unknown behavior.
